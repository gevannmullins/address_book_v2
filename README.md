# Before we get started, some useful information

The system works best if it is setup to use a virtualHost
The system needs to have a Database connection for everything to work.
In the SQL directory you will find a copy of the database table that I dump for you to get started.
The core code of this frameWork is not exactly mine, I have made a lot of adjustments to the core tho.
So, to some degree I would like to think that I have improved the code.

Please follow instructions below and enjoy...

This is an [open-source](LICENSE), simple, partially naked MVC framework for building web applications in PHP. It was first created by [daveh](https://github.com/daveh/php-mvc), but I have modified it making it 
a boitlerplate for all my future projects.


## Starting an application using this framework

1. First, download the framework, either directly or by cloning the repo.
1. Run **composer update** to install the project dependencies.
1. Configure your web server to have the **public** folder as the web root.
1. Open [.env](.env) and enter your database configuration data. Modifying this file instead of the [App/Config.php](App/Config.php) is pretty useful when working with multiple enviroments (e.g separate developement and production server.)
1. Create routes [App/Routes.php](App/Routes.php), add controllers, views and models.

See below for more details.

## Configuration

Configuration settings are stored in both [.env](.env) file and [App/Config.php](App/Config.php) class. Default settings include database connection data, twig cache location and live auto reload ..etc. You can access the settings in your code like this: `Config::DB_HOST` or `Config::env('DB_HOST')`.
The `function env('setting')` can be used to retrieve the .env stored settings. If none found, it falls back to the config class const.
You can add your own configuration settings to the [.env](.env) file or [App/Config.php](App/Config.php).

## Routing

The [Router](Core/Router.php) translates URLs into controllers and actions. Routes are added in the [front controller](App/Routes.php). A sample home route is included that routes to the `index` action in the [Home controller](App/Controllers/Home.php).

Routes are added with the `repond` method. You can add fixed URL routes, and specify the controller and action, like this:

```php
$router->respond('GET', '/hello-world', function () {
    return 'Hello World!';
});
```

Or you can add route **variables**, like this:

```php
$router->respond('/[:name]', function ($request) {
    return 'Hello ' . $request->name;
});
```

To specify a **controller** and **action** foreach route, use the following method:

```php
$router->respondWithController('GET', '/[:name]', 'controller@action');
```
in this case the route parameter can be accessed using
```php
$request->name
```

Since I'm using the [Klein.php](https://github.com/klein/klein.php) router, please refer to the documentation for more info about how to use.

## Controllers

Controllers respond to user actions (clicking on a link, submitting a form etc.). Controllers are classes that extend the [Core\Controller](Core/Controller.php) class.

Controllers are stored in the `App/Controllers` folder. A sample [Home controller](App/Controllers/Home.php) included. Controller classes need to be in the `App/Controllers` namespace. You can add subdirectories to organise your controllers, so when adding a route for these controllers you need to specify the namespace (see the routing section above).

Controller classes contain methods that can be called through the router. The sample controller in [App/Controllers/Home.php](App/Controllers/Home.php) has a sample `index` action.

You can access route parameters (for example the **name** parameter shown in the route examples above) in actions via the `$request->name` property.

### Action filters

Controllers can have **before** and **after** filter methods. These are methods that are called before and after **every** action method call in a controller. Useful for authentication for example, making sure that a user is logged in before letting them execute an action. Optionally add a **before filter** to a controller like this:

```php
/**
 * Before filter. Return false to stop the action from executing.
 *
 * @return void
 */
protected function before()
{
}
```

To stop the originally called action from executing, return `false` from the before filter method. An **after filter** is added like this:

```php
/**
 * After filter.
 *
 * @return void
 */
protected function after()
{
}

```
IMPORTANT : In order to use the before and after methods implemented, make sure to add **Action** suffix to the called method in the router.
```php
// Example: the controller has a method called show()
// to execute the before() and after() methods, the route should be something like this:
$router->respondWithController('GET', '/[:name]', 'controller@showAction');
// If you don't want to use the before and after methods, simply do this.
$router->respondWithController('GET', '/[:name]', 'controller@action');
```
## Views

Views are used to display information (normally HTML). View files go in the `App/Views` folder. Views can be in one of two formats: standard PHP, but with just enough PHP to show the data. No database access or anything like that should occur in a view file. You can render a standard PHP view in a controller, optionally passing in variables, like this:

```php
View::render('Home/index.php', [
    'name'    => 'Dave',
    'colours' => ['red', 'green', 'blue']
]);
```

The second format uses the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) templating engine. Using Twig allows you to have simpler, safer templates that can take advantage of things like [template inheritance](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/doc/templates.html#template-inheritance). You can render a Twig template like this:

```php
View::renderTemplate('Home/index.html', [
    'name'    => 'Dave',
    'colours' => ['red', 'green', 'blue']
]);
```

A sample Twig template is included in [App/Views/Home/index.html](App/Views/Home/index.html) that inherits from the base template in [App/Views/base.html](App/Views/base.html).

*HTML Compression* for Twig:
I've added an HTML Compression extention to twig, so don't forget to add the following tags before and after your html.

```html
    {% htmlcompress %} 
        <html>...</html>
    {% endhtmlcompress %}
```

## Models

Models are used to get and store data in your application. They know nothing about how this data is to be presented in the views. Models extend the `Core\Model` class and use [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) to access the database. They're stored in the `App/Models` folder. A sample user model class is included in [App/Models/User.php](App/Models/User.php). You can get the PDO database connection instance like this:

```php
$db = static::getDB();
```

## Errors

I'm using Whoops to handle errors. It's better <3. But you can still use this by removing this section from index.php [L39 - L43] :
```php
// Whoops error handling
$whoops = new Whoops\Run();
// Set Whoops as the default error and exception handler used by PHP:
$whoops->register();
$whoops->pushHandler(new Whoops\Handler\PrettyPageHandler());
```
And replacing it with this :
```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
set_error_handler('Core\Error::errorHandler');
set_exception_handler('Core\Error::exceptionHandler');
```
If the `SHOW_ERRORS` configuration setting is set to `true`, full error detail will be shown in the browser if an error or exception occurs. If it's set to `false`, a generic message will be shown using the [App/Views/404.html](App/Views/404.html) or [App/Views/500.html](App/Views/500.html) views, depending on the error.

## Web server configuration

Pretty URLs are enabled using web server rewrite rules. An [.htaccess](public/.htaccess) file is included in the `public` folder. Equivalent nginx configuration is in the [nginx-configuration.txt](nginx-configuration.txt) file.
